# Student-Dropout-Prediction
This project aims to analyze student data and build machine learning models to predict whether a student is likely to Dropout, remain Enrolled, or Graduate. The goal is to support educational institutions in identifying at-risk students early, enabling timely interventions to improve academic success and retention rates.
