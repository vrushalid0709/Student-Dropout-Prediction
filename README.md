# Student-Dropout-Prediction
This project aims to analyze student data and build machine learning models to predict whether a student is likely to Dropout, remain Enrolled, or Graduate. The goal is to support educational institutions in identifying at-risk students early, enabling timely interventions to improve academic success and retention rates.

🔍 Project Overview

Educational dropout is a critical challenge faced by universities worldwide. By leveraging student demographic, academic, and socio-economic data, this project builds predictive models to classify student outcomes. The study includes data exploration, feature analysis, model building, and model evaluation to identify key factors contributing to student dropout.

✅ Key Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and important factors influencing student status.

Preprocess and scale data for model training.

Train multiple ML classification models to predict student outcomes.

Compare model performances using evaluation metrics.

Provide predictions for new/unseen student data.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

🔮 Outcome

The Random Forest model achieved the best performance among the tested models, making it suitable for predicting student outcomes. The model can be used to flag students who might be at risk of dropping out so institutions can take preventive action.
